# 🚛 TransitOps — Smart Fleet Operations Management System

> A full-stack MERN Fleet Management ERP for logistics and transportation companies — built to digitize dispatch, driver management, maintenance, and operational analytics.


🏆 **Built during a hackathon** — designed and developed under time constraints to demonstrate a production-style fleet operations platform.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Logistics and transportation companies still rely heavily on manual, disconnected processes to run their fleets:

- **Manual dispatch** — trips are assigned over calls or spreadsheets, with no system-level validation of vehicle or driver readiness.
- **Poor fleet visibility** — there is no single source of truth for which vehicles are available, on a trip, or in the shop.
- **Untracked maintenance** — vehicles requiring repair are not automatically taken out of rotation, creating safety and reliability risks.
- **Fragmented driver management** — license validity, availability, and performance are tracked inconsistently, if at all.
- **Operational inefficiency** — without real-time status tracking, dispatchers make decisions on outdated or incomplete information.

These gaps lead to delayed trips, safety violations, unplanned downtime, and a lack of accountability across fleet operations.

---

## 💡 Solution

**TransitOps** centralizes fleet operations into a single ERP-style platform with enforced business rules — not just CRUD screens.

The system tracks the real-time status of every vehicle and driver, validates every dispatch against safety and capacity constraints, and automatically updates statuses as trips and maintenance events progress. This removes manual coordination overhead and prevents invalid operational states (e.g., dispatching an unavailable driver or an in-shop vehicle) before they happen.

## 🧠 Business Logic

TransitOps is built around enforced operational rules, not just data storage. The system actively prevents invalid fleet states:

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Vehicle cannot be dispatched if already on a trip | ✅ Validated at dispatch |
| Driver cannot be dispatched if unavailable | ✅ Validated at dispatch |
| Driver with an expired license cannot be assigned | ✅ Validated at dispatch |
| Cargo cannot exceed vehicle capacity | ✅ Validated at dispatch |
| Vehicle status updates automatically | ✅ On dispatch / completion / maintenance |
| Driver status updates automatically | ✅ On dispatch / completion |
| Maintenance automatically blocks vehicle dispatch | ✅ Vehicle marked "In Shop" |

This rule engine is what separates TransitOps from a basic CRUD application — it models the actual operational constraints of running a fleet.
